# Working with AI

This is a collection of resources, skills, and notes that I either create myself or copy from around the web.

Use it at your own risk :)

## Intro

In this repo, I use `[my-app]` as a placeholder for well... my app's name.

## Tools

I use a combination of apps to achieve the best results possible:

- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/): Mandatory to code apps for Apple devices
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code): For now I'm working mainly with Anthropic's tool but I'll explore more in the future
- [GitHub](https://github.com): To store all of my projects in git
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/copilot): Mainly to automatically run tasks from Linear in the background
- [Linear](https://linear.app): A gorgeous planner and task manager that integrates with multiple tools
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com): A terminal app for macOS with lots of useful features and customisation options
- [Nova](https://nova.app/): The most beautiful code editor there is!
